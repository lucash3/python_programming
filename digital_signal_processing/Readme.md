## Digital Signal Processing in Python 📡

💻 Foundational DSP theory. Entire semester of “Signals and Systems”, a course within electrical engineering.

Here I utilize especially NumPy, which is Python’s standard library for arrays and high-level math. The codes also rely upon Matplotlib, which is a Python plotting library that provides an easy way to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers.
During the semester i've noted that while Python is “slower” than C++ in general, most math functions within Python/NumPy are implemented in C/C++ and heavily optimized. Likewise, the SDR API used is simply a set of Python bindings for C/C++ functions/classes.
