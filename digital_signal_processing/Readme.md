## Digital Signal Processing in Python üì°

üíª Foundational DSP theory. Entire semester of ‚ÄúSignals and Systems‚Äù, a course within electrical engineering.

Here I utilize especially NumPy, which is Python‚Äôs standard library for arrays and high-level math. The codes also rely upon Matplotlib, which is a Python plotting library that provides an easy way to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers.
During the semester i've noted that while Python is ‚Äúslower‚Äù than C++ in general, most math functions within Python/NumPy are implemented in C/C++ and heavily optimized. Likewise, the SDR API used is simply a set of Python bindings for C/C++ functions/classes.

Throughout the course we've used generic complex baseband simulation techniques, to simulate several M-ary schemas, such as BPSK, FSK, AKS, PSK and QAM. 
We also simulate bit error rate performance (BER) over AWGN channel using complex baseband equivalent models.

The final project was the construction of a [full Modulator-Demodulator (MoDem) using object-oriented programming in Python](https://github.com/lucash3/python_programming/blob/main/digital_signal_processing/M-ary%20Digital%20Modulation%20Techniques/M-ary_Digital_Mod-Demod.ipynb)
